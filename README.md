Pig-Dice-Game
=============

A working, yet incomplete and un-polished implementation of the game "Pig". When first tasked
to implement this game at University, the result can only be summarised as a "gigantic while loop". Having
not worked with Java for nearly a year nor GitHub for that matter, I felt this repository was a good way
to re-familiarise myself with the Java language and a couple of its new Java 8 features. When the code was written, it 
gave me a good opportunity to play with GitHub.

###Gameplay

1. If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.
2. If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.
3. If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.

The first player to reach a pre-determined score wins the game.
